				 <p class="history">
				 
					 Borgo Panigale: what was once just a grouping of farms and country houses is now a 
					 thriving neighbourhood in the western suburbs of Bologna. The town began growing and
					 becoming more distinguished back in 1935 when the Cavalieri Ducati brothers, Adriano, 
					 Bruno and Marcello, began building the Ducati Factory. Since 1946, this large factory 
					 is known as the home of the Reds of Borgo Panigale... But, by looking back at the history 
					 of Ducati, one can learn that the company was not really born in Borgo Panigale.

				 </p>
				 
				 <p class="history">
							Not everyone knows that the origins of Ducati are in the heart of Bologna. The company, 
							Societ√† Scientifica Radio Brevetti Ducati (Ducati's original name), was founded on July 
							4th, 1926. The first headquarters were in the centre of town, in Via Collegio di Spagna 9, 
							right next door to the Collegio di Spagna itself, an institute for Spanish students in Bologna. 
							The three Ducati brothers rented three rooms on the ground floor to start their business while
					their initial workshop was located in the basement of their family's villa, Villa Lydia, in Viale Guidotti, 51.
